## Description
* Track My Budget is an application that allows users to add and subtract expenses to their budgets. This application allows for offline access and functionality, without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total will be updated when they're brought back online. This application uses `service worker`, `web manifest`, and `IndexedDB` for offline functionality.
